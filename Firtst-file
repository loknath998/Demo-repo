This is my first file in the demo repository

line 2 is on line 3.

writing a for loop for printing number 1 to 10
for(i=0; i<11; i++)
{
  print(i);
}

mehool added line number 11 just to use the fork and pull request feature

adding another loop to print number form 10 to 1
for(i=10; i>0; i--)
{
  print(i);
}

lets modify this branch by adding a hello function to it
function hello(){
  print("hello from gihub");
}

mehool here updating the file


class MyClass{
  int rollno;
  String Name;
}
